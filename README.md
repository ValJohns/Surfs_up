## Summary: 
### After obtaining the requested information, I would looking in the amounts of rains downfall via precipations measurements. I would look into obtaining that query because if it is raining customer will not come to the Surf Shop. The second query I would look into is for hurricanes in the area. This would be for protecting the building structure.
